<h3 id="label-Foreword">Foreword</h3>

<p>The author of this module has long promoted a line of thinking that builds
off of <strong>Infrastructure As Code</strong> into <strong>Infrastructure
As Data</strong>. With Hiera and modules like this, you can express your
entire enterprise infrastructure purely as data without any more code for
you to write or manage (not even antiquated roles/profiles). As such, all
examples in this document and the module&#39;s in-file documentation are
presented strictly as YAML.</p>

<h2 id="label-Description">Description</h2>

<p>This module was written from scratch, specifically for Puppet 5 and Hiera 5
to fully manage dovecot; nothing more and nothing less. No assumptions are
made as to what you intend to do with dovecot other than install or
uninstall it and its plugins, configure it or delete its configuration
files, and – when not ignoring it – keep its service running or not
running.</p>

<p>Here, “fully manage” means this Puppet module:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Installs, upgrades, downgrades, version-pins, and uninstalls dovecot and
its plugins.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Controls every line in every dovecot configuration file, both vendor- and
user-supplied.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Optionally controls the dovecot service.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>This is one of a generation of Puppet modules that fully extends control
over the subject resources to Hiera. Use modules like this where you&#39;d
rather express your infrastructure as data without any further Puppet code
beyond the modules that make this possible.</p>

<h2 id="label-Setup">Setup</h2>

<h3 id="label-What+dovecot+affects">What dovecot affects</h3>

<p>This module specifically affects the following resources:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The primary dovecot package, or whatever it is named for your platform.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Any set of dovecot plugin packages that you define, including what to do
with them.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Every line of every file in the dovecot configuration directory and its
conf.d subdirectory.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The dovecot service – by any name – if you so choose.</p>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-Setup+Requirements">Setup Requirements</h3>

<p>Please refer to the <em>dependencies</em> section of <a
href="metadata.json">metadata.json</a> to learn what other modules this one
needs, if any.</p>

<h3 id="label-Beginning+with+dovecot">Beginning with dovecot</h3>

<p>At its simplest, you can install dovecot in its vendor-supplied default
state merely with:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">---
classes:
  - dovecot</code></pre>

<h2 id="label-Usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Many usage examples are provided via the source code documentation. Refer
to the <a href="#reference">Reference</a> section to learn how to access
it.</p>

<h2 id="label-Reference">Reference</h2>

<p>This module is extensively documented via <a
href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-strings">Puppet Strings</a>.
Install support for and run the <code>puppet strings</code> command to
access the navigable documentation.</p>

<h2 id="label-Limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>Please refer to the <em>operatingsystem_support</em> section of <a
href="metadata.json">metadata.json</a> for OS compatibility. This is not an
exhaustive list. You will very likely find that this module runs just fine
on other operating system and version combinations, given the proper
inputs.</p>

<h2 id="label-Development">Development</h2>

<p>This module was written so generically that there really shouldn&#39;t be
any need to change any of the Puppet code. However, there is abundant
opportunity to add more default Hiera data for operating systems that I
simply don&#39;t bother with. Should you find yourself interested in adding
support for your favorite operating system – and the existing defaults
specifically do not cover it – please feel free to open a Pull Request that
adds the missing data.</p>
